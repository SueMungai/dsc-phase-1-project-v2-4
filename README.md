# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

## 1. Project Overview 
Microsoft has utilized data science to assist decide how to approach its interest in joining
the film business. To provide solid justification, the data scientist will perform
exploratory data analysis from several movie websites to collect and analyse the data and make useful insights. 

## 1.1 Understanding the problem
The goal of the problem statement is to identify the industry's dominant genre and how it relates to the top grossing movies. Microsoft will utilize this data to decide what sorts of movies to produce, as well as their length and genre. Microsoft must be aware of competing studios entering the market, as well as the kind of filmmakers and performers who are involved in or featured in the highest-grossing movies.


# DATA UNDERSTANDING
## 2. DATA COLLECTION 

The information provided was from The Box Office Mojo, IMDb, and The Numbers, which are the websites that were mined for the data. These are websites and online databases that have information that tracks box office revenue, gives information on films and of the cast, the production and direction, ratings and reviews, and even provides plot summaries of said films. 

## 2.1 DATA DESCRIPTION
These datasets from Box Office Mojo and The Numbers provide information regarding the movie's title, the production budget, as well as the domestic and international gross of the film. The IMDb dataset is made up of many tables, each of which contains a different kind of information. Some of these tables include the basics of movies, such as the run time in minutes of each film, ratings and reviews, cast members, directors, and writers.

# DATA ANALYSIS 
According to the statistics provided by Box Office Mojo, the modal production company is IFC, the modal movie's name is Bluebeard, and
the modal year is 2015, which indicates that the majority of movies were released in that year.
The IMDb information revealed that Drama was the genre that was produced the most often alongside documentaries. Over the course of the last five years, feature films typically ran for between 84 and 89 minutesâ€™ total. Tony Newton, Shane Ryan, and Jason Impey were among the most accomplished directors.
According to the statistics from The Numbers, the most common movie is Halloween; the most common production budget for movies is twenty million dollars; and the most common gross profit for movies is a negative to illustrate that the majority of films did not generate enough money to cover their production costs. The Numbers dataset included an examination of the top 10 movies in terms of the global market. Both the gross amount as well as the gross profit, which is the difference between the production budget and the gross amount. In terms of high gross profit, the film Avatar is the biggest earning film of all time. In addition, during the course of the last ten years, the month that has seen the widest variety of new film releases has been December. 

# CONCLUSION
The average run length duration of movies over the past decade has been an average of 80 to 100 minutes. The duration has fluctuated over the year but remained the said average time. 
The correlation between the production budget and the gross profit is 0.60875214717188. A moderate positive correlation of 0.6 is good and this means that indeed the production budget has a positive relationship with the profit. When a good investment is made on a film, this results in high returns. See Jupyter notebbok for full data analysis and data visualizations of the above summary. 

# RECOMMENDATIONS
The findings of the study presented above lead one to the conclusion that there is, in fact, a positive link between the production budget and the gross profit.
The top three directors at Microsoft are Tony Newton (15.6%), Jason Impey (12.4%), and Shane Ryan (12.2%), and the company will need to recruit all three of them.
When getting started, there is one more element that should be taken into account, and that is the run time minutes of movies. Over the last ten years, the typical run length of a movie has been between 80 and 100 minutes.
